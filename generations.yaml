    description: "The Smart #1 (pronounced 'Smart Hashtag One') represents a complete reinvention of the Smart brand under joint ownership by Mercedes-Benz and Geely, marking a dramatic departure from the microcar concept that defined Smart for over two decades. Developed primarily by Geely on its Sustainable Experience Architecture (SEA) platform but with Mercedes-Benz design input, the Smart #1 is a compact electric crossover SUV measuring approximately 4.27 meters in lengthâ€”significantly larger than any previous Smart model. The exterior design, led by Mercedes' design team, features smooth, rounded forms with distinctive elements including a floating roof, concealed door handles, and frameless doors, balancing the friendly character of the original Smart with a more premium and contemporary appearance. Powered by a rear-mounted electric motor producing 268 horsepower (200 kW) and 343 Nm of torque in standard form, the #1 can accelerate from 0-62 mph in 6.7 seconds, with a performance-oriented Brabus variant adding a front motor for a combined 422 horsepower (315 kW), enabling 0-62 mph in just 3.9 seconds. A 66 kWh battery provides a WLTP range of approximately 273 miles (440 km), with DC fast charging capability of up to 150 kW allowing a 10-80% charge in less than 30 minutes. The interior represents a significant premium positioning with a minimalist design centered around a 12.8-inch floating central touchscreen, 9.2-inch digital instrument cluster, and 10-inch head-up display, all powered by a custom operating system with a distinctive avatar assistant. Premium features include a panoramic glass roof, 13-speaker Beats audio system, and extensive ambient lighting. Advanced driver assistance systems provide Level 2 semi-autonomous driving capabilities. As the first model in Smart's new all-electric lineup (to be followed by the larger #3 and #5 models), the #1 signals a dramatic shift in the brand's strategy, targeting the premium compact EV segment rather than the specialized urban mobility niche of its predecessors, while attempting to retain some of Smart's distinctive character and design philosophy in a more mainstream package."
